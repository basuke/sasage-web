# Repository Analysis & Improvement Recommendations

## Overview
This is a SvelteKit-based portfolio website for Mayumi Sasage, an illustrator and artist. The site features bilingual support (English/Japanese), image galleries, and integration with Cloudflare Images for optimization.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework**: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with PostCSS
- **Image Storage**: Cloudflare Images
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploy from main branch)
- **Testing**: Playwright
- **Package Manager**: pnpm

## Key Improvement Opportunities

### Code Quality & Architecture

**1. Package Manager Inconsistency**
- README mentions `yarn` but project uses `pnpm` (lock file present)
- Update README.md to reflect actual package manager

**2. TypeScript Configuration**
- Missing explicit `@types/node` dependency
- Could enable stricter TypeScript rules like `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`

**3. Component Organization**
- Large `data.ts` file (360+ lines) could be split into separate modules
- Consider extracting work definitions to JSON/YAML files

### Performance Optimizations

**4. Image Loading**
- Already implements lazy loading and responsive images 
- Consider adding `fetchpriority="high"` for above-the-fold images
- Add image preloading for slideshow next images

**5. Bundle Optimization**
- Add bundle analyzer to identify optimization opportunities
- Consider code splitting for route-based chunks
- Implement service worker for offline caching

**6. CSS Improvements**
- Tailwind classes in `image-grid.svelte:22,28,33,38` use dynamic values that may not be in build
- Extract to proper Tailwind configuration or use CSS Grid properties

### Developer Experience

**7. Development Tooling**
- Add `eslint-plugin-svelte` for better Svelte linting
- Consider adding Husky for pre-commit hooks
- Add editor configuration (.editorconfig)

**8. Testing**
- Only Playwright tests exist - consider adding unit tests with Vitest
- Add component testing for Svelte components

**9. Documentation**
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document image upload workflow and Cloudflare setup
- Add contributing guidelines

### Security & Best Practices

**10. Environment Variables**
- Good `.gitignore` setup for secrets 
- Consider adding `.env.example` file

**11. Accessibility**
- Add focus management for slideshow navigation
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Add skip navigation links

### Infrastructure

**12. CI/CD Improvements**
- Add automated testing in GitHub Actions
- Add lighthouse CI for performance monitoring
- Consider automated dependency updates (Dependabot)

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Run tests
pnpm test

# Lint and format code
pnpm lint
pnpm format

# Type checking
pnpm check

# Upload images to Cloudflare
pnpm upload-images
```

## Architecture Notes

### Main Routes
- `/` - Homepage with works and illustrations grids
- `/works/[...id]` - Individual work detail pages  
- `/images/[...id]` - Image detail/slideshow pages
- `/about` - About page
- `/collections/[...id]` - Collection pages

### Image Pipeline
1. Local images stored in `/images/` directory
2. Upload script (`scripts/upload.mjs`) processes and uploads to Cloudflare Images
3. Image metadata stored in `src/images.json`
4. Dynamic image variants served via Cloudflare Images CDN

### Content Management
- Content definitions in `src/lib/data.ts`
- Bilingual support via `TranslatableString` type
- Works and illustrations managed as TypeScript objects

## Key Files to Understand

- `src/lib/data.ts` - Main data definitions and image utilities
- `src/lib/img.svelte` - Responsive image component with Cloudflare integration
- `src/lib/image-grid.svelte` - Grid layout for image galleries
- `scripts/upload.mjs` - Image upload automation
- `src/images.json` - Image metadata (generated by upload script)
